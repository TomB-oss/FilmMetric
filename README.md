# FilmMetric

## Description

The goal is to build some statistics using movie data. The data are from:

**Scraped**:

- [Wikipedia Academy Award Winning Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Academy_Award-winning_films)

**API**:

- [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

**Local**:

- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download)

_I scraped IMDB data but they change their class names after some time. Therefore, I decided to stop using them._
